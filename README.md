REFLECTION:

Assignment1,2,3
Summary:
The industrial talk provided valuable insights into the current trends and challenges within the tech industry. Learning directly from professionals offered a practical perspective on how theoretical knowledge applies in real-world scenarios. The talk emphasized the importance of continuous learning, adaptability, and staying abreast of emerging technologies. I gained a deeper understanding of the industry's expectations and the significance of soft skills in the workplace.Our recent industrial visit to Indah water Services in Malyaysia provided an eye opening experience into the world of sewage treatment plants and the innovative technologies employed to ensure effecient and sustaniable wastewater management. The viist deepened our understanding of the various stages involved in wastewater treatment and showcased the commitment to environmental responsibility. 

Suggestions for Improvement:
To enhance future industrial talks, incorporating more interactive elements, such as Q&A sessions or panel discussions, could foster deeper engagement. Additionally, providing more specific examples of successful projects or case studies would further enrich the learning experience.More deep understanding of the processess used in the system.

 Other Reflections:
Personally, I found the emphasis on cross-disciplinary skills and the value of networking to be particularly insightful. The talk has inspired me to explore interdisciplinary collaborations and to actively seek networking opportunities within the industry.

PC assemble/dissamble
Summary:
Focused on the hands-on experience of assembling a PC, offering a practical application of theoretical knowledge gained in hardware-related courses. This assignment not only deepened my understanding of computer components but also highlighted the importance of precision and attention to detail in hardware assembly. Witnessing the entire process from start to finish provided a holistic view of PC manufacturing.

Suggestions for Improvement:
Incorporating a brief session on troubleshooting common hardware issues could be beneficial. This would further empower students with practical skills and problem-solving techniques, complementing the assembly process.

 Other Reflections:
This assignment reinforced the idea that theoretical knowledge gains practical significance through hands-on experiences. It sparked an interest in exploring further aspects of hardware and encouraged me to consider pursuing additional courses in this domain.

Assignment 3: Design Thinking

 Summary:
The design thinking assignment challenged me to approach problem-solving with a user-centric mindset. It emphasized empathy, ideation, and prototyping as essential stages in the creative process. Collaborating with team members allowed for diverse perspectives, enriching the ideation phase and leading to innovative solutions.

 Suggestions for Improvement:
To enhance the design thinking assignment, incorporating more structured feedback sessions during the ideation and prototyping phases would provide valuable insights. Additionally, encouraging experimentation with unconventional ideas could foster even more creative solutions.

Other Reflections:
This assignment not only enhanced my problem-solving skills but also underscored the significance of effective teamwork in the creative process. It has inspired me to integrate design thinking principles into future projects, ensuring a user-focused approach in both software and hardware development.

Overall, these assignments have significantly contributed to my holistic learning experience, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. They have ignited a passion for continuous learning and a deeper appreciation for the multifaceted nature of the tech industry.
